# BPTracker
BPTrack Blood Pressure Tracking Application for iOS

This project is a historical artifact rather than as living project as this project is not expected to be updated any longer since the functionality it provided is now a feature of Health Kit.  My hope is that someone will be able to learn from it.

Note that it used the Core Plot project for displaying the blood pressure graph. As that project is also fouund on GitHub its source is not included here.
