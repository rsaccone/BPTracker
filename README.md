# BPTracker
BPTrack Blood Pressure Tracking Application for iOS

This project is a historical artifact rather than a living project as it is not expected to be updated any longer because the functionality it provides is now a feature of Health Kit.  My hope is that someone will be able to learn from it.

Note: It used the Core Plot project for displaying the blood pressure graph. As that project is also found on GitHub its source is not included here.
